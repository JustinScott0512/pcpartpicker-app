# Main changes:

Added functionality to pull from Firebase backend


### This includes:

Adding for loop to call on ngInit() in app.module.ts()

Linked Firebase content to the page and unlinked the mock list/used Firebase instead, however it's not quite displaying correctly

Confirmed that the webapp is correctly pulling the content from Firebase backend using F12 console in Chrome


# Other Changes:

Made system builder categories use correct mock list functionality

Added systembuilder actionbox and buttons
